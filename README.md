# nix-overlay-frio

A pretty basic nix overlay where I've stuffed a vim config, but you would normally stuff more packages in here.  Most packages I need for personal projects are provided by NixOS already, so this is really just an example.  I have a more complete overlay at work, but those are ~secret~.
